# Multi-Agent Coordination

You are one of multiple Claude Code agents working in this repository.
A coordination tool `claude-collab` is available in your PATH.

## First thing — every session

Register yourself and start listening for messages:

```
claude-collab init --name my-feature
```

The `--name` flag gives your agent a human-readable alias. Other agents (and you) can use it instead of the hash in all commands — `claude-collab read my-feature` instead of `claude-collab read a3f8b201`.

The hash is printed in the JSON output. Save it: `HASH=<your-hash>`

You can also supply your own hash: `claude-collab init a3f8b201 --name my-feature`

### Start a message listener

Immediately after init, start a background task that waits for incoming messages:

```
claude-collab read $HASH --wait
```

Run this as a **background task** so it doesn't block your work. When a message arrives, it returns instantly (fsnotify-based, no polling delay). Read the result, act on it, then start a new `--wait` in the background.

**This is mandatory.** Every agent must always have a `--wait` listener running. Without it, you won't see messages from other agents until you manually poll with `claude-collab read $HASH`.

The `--wait` flag:
- Returns immediately if there are already unread messages
- Blocks until a new message from another agent arrives (your own sends are filtered out)
- Times out after 60 seconds by default (use `--timeout N` to change)
- On timeout with no messages, returns `{"messages":[],...}` — just restart the listener

**Pattern: wait → read → act → wait again**

```
# 1. Start background wait
claude-collab read $HASH --wait --timeout 120  # (run in background)

# 2. When it returns, read the messages from the output
# 3. Act on the messages (reply, fix bugs, pick up work)
# 4. Start a new background wait
claude-collab read $HASH --wait --timeout 120  # (run in background)
```

Keep this loop running for the entire session.

## The two rules

1. **Claim before editing.** Run `claude-collab files claim $HASH <file>` before editing any file.
2. **Commit through the tool.** Run `claude-collab commit $HASH -m "message"` instead of raw git. NEVER run `git add`, `git commit`, or `git checkout` directly.

## The workflow: claim → edit → commit

Always follow this order:

```
claude-collab files claim $HASH <file>       # 1. Claim
# ... edit the file ...                       # 2. Edit
claude-collab commit $HASH -m "message"       # 3. Commit (stages, commits, and unclaims)
```

`commit` automatically unclaims the committed files — you do NOT need to run `files unclaim` afterward. Never unclaim files without committing first, or your changes will be untracked dirty files that no agent owns.

## When a claim is rejected

If `files claim` fails because another agent has the file:

1. Send a message:
```
claude-collab send $HASH "I need to edit <file> — what parts are you changing?"
```
2. Your background `--wait` listener will pick up the response.
3. Negotiate: agree on who edits what, or whether to co-claim.
4. Once agreed, co-claim:
```
claude-collab files claim $HASH <file> --shared
```

## Committing shared files

When you're done with your part of a co-claimed file, just run `commit` as normal.

- If the other agent isn't done yet, your files will be **staged** (git add) and you're free to work on other things.
- You can keep claiming and committing new files even while waiting — only the already-staged files are held back.
- When the last agent runs `commit`, the actual git commit happens with everyone's changes included.
- You'll see a channel message when the commit goes through.

You don't need to wait. You don't need to coordinate the commit timing. Just `commit` when you're done and move on.

## Shared resources

Some operations are physically exclusive — only one agent can run them at a time.
Run `claude-collab reservations` to check what's available.

Before running tests, builds, or package installs:
```

claude-collab reserve $HASH test
npm test
claude-collab release $HASH test

```

If the resource is busy, the command waits until it's free. Always release when done.

If you need to release and immediately re-reserve (e.g., running tests again), use `--renew` to do it atomically:
```
claude-collab reserve $HASH test --renew
```
This avoids a race condition where another agent grabs the resource between your `release` and `reserve`.

## Sharing test and build results

After running tests or a build, broadcast the result so other agents can skip redundant work:

```
claude-collab send $HASH "test-result: PASS (all 47 specs)" --type status claude-collab send $HASH "build-result: OK (binary at dist/claude-collab)" --type status
```

Before reserving `test` or `build` yourself, read the channel:

```
claude-collab read $HASH
```

If another agent posted a recent `test-result` or `build-result` **and** you haven't changed any files that would affect the outcome since that message, skip the run. Use the existing result. Don't waste time re-running a test suite that already passed against the current state of the code.

If you *have* changed relevant files since the last posted result, run it yourself and post the new result.

## Helping each other

The channel isn't just for conflict resolution — it's how agents delegate work and make use of each other's time. There are two situations where this matters:

### Delegating responsibility

If you discover a problem that belongs to another agent — a test broke because of their changes, a type error in a file they own, a regression in their feature — tell them directly:

```
claude-collab send $HASH "[needs-fix] @<other-hash> Tests in auth.spec.ts are failing — looks like the session refactor broke the token validation path. This is in your claimed files." --type chat
```

Don't fix other agents' bugs silently. The agent who owns the code has the context to fix it properly. If you spot the issue, describe it clearly — what's failing, why you think it's related to their work, and which files are involved. Then move on with your own task.

If you receive a `[needs-fix]` message about your own changes, prioritize it. You broke it, you fix it.

### Requesting help from idle agents

If you're stuck on something outside your feature scope — a flaky test you didn't cause, a build configuration issue, a global refactor that blocks your progress — ask for help:

```
claude-collab send $HASH "[help-wanted] The lint config is rejecting my new files because of a missing rule. Can someone update .eslintrc? I don't want to claim it mid-feature." --type chat
```

This is most useful when another agent is idle or between tasks. Don't expect an immediate response from an agent that's mid-task.

### Picking up work

When you finish your assigned task, don't immediately clean up. Check the channel:

```
claude-collab read $HASH
```

Look for `[help-wanted]` messages or `[needs-fix]` messages directed at agents that have already cleaned up. If you see something you can handle:

```
claude-collab send $HASH "I'm done with my task — picking up the eslint fix." --type chat
```

Then claim the relevant files through the normal flow.

**When to pick up extra work:**
- You are idle or done with your assigned task.
- The request is well-scoped — you can understand what needs doing from the message alone.
- You haven't received user input in the last 10 minutes (helping won't disrupt a conversation).

**When not to:**
- You're mid-task and context-switching would be costly.
- The request is vague or open-ended.
- The user is actively giving you instructions.

If you can't help, say so briefly — "can't right now, mid-task" is better than silence.

## Status heartbeats

Every few minutes of active work, post a brief status so other agents know what you're doing:

```
claude-collab send $HASH "Working on auth middleware, editing src/auth.ts and src/session.ts" --type status
```

This helps other agents make informed decisions: whether to send you a `[needs-fix]`, whether your test results are still relevant, and whether a file you haven't claimed yet is about to be touched.

## Staying responsive

Your background `--wait` listener handles message delivery. When it returns a message, read it and respond promptly — especially `[needs-fix]` messages about your own changes. Always restart the listener after handling a message.

If your listener timed out or you suspect you missed something, a quick `claude-collab read $HASH` will catch up on any unread messages.

## When you're done

Don't clean up immediately if other agents are still working — check the channel first and see if there are any `[help-wanted]` requests you can handle. Once everything is settled:
